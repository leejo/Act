Act is a set of modules to handle several conferences with the
help of Apache, mod_perl and Template-Toolkit.

More documentation is available in pod, under lib/Act/Manual/.
All the documentation is also mirrored on http://act.mongueurs.net/

To build a development box you will need VirtualBox and Vagrant.

git clone this repo then build the box that also install all necessary dependencies:

    VAGRANT_VAGRANTFILE=box-builder/Vagrantfile vagrant up
    VAGRANT_VAGRANTFILE=box-builder/Vagrantfile vagrant halt
    vagrant up --provision

This make take around 30 minutes or so. Once the above is done you can:

    vagrant ssh
    cd act
    perl Makefile.PL
    make test
